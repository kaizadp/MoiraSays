My dear Bébé - at last, a digital reliquary devoted entirely to my most luminescent utterances.

This R package delivers a cascade of Moira Rose quotations at the merest whim, perfect for elevating your pedestrian code into something positively operatic.

Do sprinkle these verbal éclats throughout your projects - after all, why should your analysis not shimmer with a touch of unbridled grandeur?
